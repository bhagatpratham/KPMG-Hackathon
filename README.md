### Problem Statement

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected educational systems globally, leading to the total closures of schools

While the decreasing motivation has already made keeping up with academic work more difficult, students have often described their workload as increasing after transitioning towards online learning.

There have been some effective attempts at engaging students in learning, but these interventions have yet to have any significant 
effect on turnout. 

- Online classes enable teachers to provide students with reading material, assignments, live chats, recorded videos, or lectures.
Despite all of these activities, some students do not find them as engaging as a traditional ones.

- Students find it really difficult to keep track of all exam schedules, assignments deadlines, learning materials and notes which has a significant impact on their grades.

- For many, the new format for their classes has left them with a lack of motivation that may affect their academic performance throughout the term
