### Problem Statement


- Lack of motivation to learn is a common challenge for students during online school/college.

- There have been some effective attempts at engaging students in learning, but these interventions have yet to have any significant 
effect on turnout. 

- Online classes enable teachers to provide students with reading material, assignments, , live chats, recorded videos, or lectures.
Despite all of these activities, some students do not find them as engaging as a traditional one.

- Students find it really difficult to keep up with all learning materials, notes and assignments which has a significant impact on their grades.

- For many, the new format for their classes has left them with a lack of motivation that may affect their academic performance throughout the term. 
While the decreasing motivation has already made keeping up with academic work more difficult, students have often described their workload as increasing after transitioning toward online learning.
